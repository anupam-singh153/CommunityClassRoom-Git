Anupam's Diary Through Out Placement Journey

From Today onwards I have started again revising DSA. But Now it feels frustated. I have learnt so many things through out my 4years course
But when it comes to revise and maintain those things Its that much challenging. 
Currently I can't do anything other than continuing hardwork and waiting for an appropriate time when I am able to cope up with all these challenges.
There is Life, There is Struggle. 
Always Be Happy, keep Smiling...
